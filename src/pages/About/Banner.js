            This type of treatment can be used regardless of what type of
            medical care you are receiving. For example, if youâ€™re taking
            medication to reduce symptoms, you can use holistic medicine to get
            to the root of the problem. Your doctor might then reduce your dose
            or allow you to stop taking the medication completely.
          </p>
          <p className="section-description">
            Both biomedicine and holistic care play integral parts in the
            healthcare landscape. As informed consumers, we can benefit from
            both.
