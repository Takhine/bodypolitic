        message: `"This is a raving review of the expertise, results & work ethics of Mona Eldahry who has been working on me since she started mastering her acupuncture & started doctorate in Chinese medicine. Without it I would still suffer from overwhelming hay fever, allergies & debilitating migraines that started at 17 2-3 times a week! My immune system would still have been a trap for every flu in town. She also fixed my back pain, numbness in my right hand fingers because of a neck disk injury, head colds & sinus, fatigue, depression, lethargy, sleeplessness  ... I was a mess after a major fall and 911 exposure in the lower east side of Manhattan & Wall street! She is putting me back together one visit at a time. Her consultations are thorough & more scientifically based than most doctors I used to go see!! Her diagnostics, reparative acupuncture & herbal healings & cures are on the money. She is up to date on the latest solid modalities! And she sure knows how yo run a space, a program, a team!! I canâ€™t wait to checkout her new practice space. I give her thumbs up!!"`,

Thanks to her acupuncture and body work techniques I felt an incredible release physically, mentally and emotionally.  I got so much out of our session - actual healing for my back injury and feeling a release and relaxation in my entire body.  I have already scheduled my next appointment!"`,
